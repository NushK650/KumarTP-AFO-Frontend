Description: The "All for One" Assignment is a comprehensive project that consolidates the mini API endpoints challenges into a 10-page web application. 
The focus of this assignment is to build out the front end using Tailwind CSS, creating a user-friendly interface for each API endpoint.


Peer review: David Monterrosa

Comments: Overall the project nostly meets the design specifications. There is one page that appears to have an issue. Your "Greater Or Less" page does not
load the background image correctly leading to an empty white background. This makes the white text impossible to read. Other than this simple fix, your
website is completely responsive from desktop to large mobile screen sizes and functions as intended.
